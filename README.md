  - Mid Game: Time to leave the game to run on its own. Try to buy more upgrade items that makes cookies in the highest percentage and do not purchase an upgrade that is
  prohibitively costly and would take an ordinate amount of time to obtain. You can do something else to occupy your time, then return to a large number of cookies to 
  spend. Obtain the Miscellanous Achievements; they will provide you with a large number of achievements. Sugar Lumps can also be obtained after baking at least 1B 
  (1 Billion) cookies.
